assignment
I had named the files with problem names in hacker rank  here.

I had written the code with python 3.5 version 
while solving the correlation 5th questions i had placed the answer on the first line with hash tag and wrote the code below 
while checking it just type only '16.0' not the total code
as there is less constraints in TRIANGLE QUEST AND TRIANGLE QUEST2 problems i had followed the diffferent approach other than choosing for loop and remainder method
as the TRIANGLE QUEST AND TRIANGLE QUEST2 problems belongs to same category i had solved extra 1 problem (ie total of 11 problems in python).
