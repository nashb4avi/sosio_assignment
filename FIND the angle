'''In a right triangle, the median drawn to the hypotenuse 
has the measure half the hypotenuse.
If in a triangle a median has the measure half the length of 
the side it is drawn to, then the triangle is a right triangle.
In a right triangle, the median drawn to the hypotenuse 
divides the triangle in two isosceles triangles.'''
